# slapjs-mobile-debugger
Mobile Browser Debugger, made from a need to debug frontend code a little easier from within a mobile browser or hybrid app, where the logging tools like dev consoles are either non-existent or just hard to get to.

The basis of this little script is a quick dirty fix to a problem with debugging a friend of mine had. Where console.log and alerts were hard to see within the context of the browser of the mobile device they were using. While developing something. Its a dirty not so fancy means of capturing and surpressing the built in behavior of the console.log and alert within browsers. Offering a button that you can toggle open/close an overlay that will display the contents of a console.log or alert.
